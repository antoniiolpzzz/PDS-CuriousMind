## Requirements and Use Cases

The **CuriousMind** application is designed based on the following functional requirements, organized into 9 main use cases.  
Each use case is documented as an individual issue in this repository, allowing for tracking and traceability.

Below is a summary:

1. **Log in 💻** ([#51](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/51))  
   Allows registered users to authenticate in the application with their credentials.

2. **Register user 👤** ([#53](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/53))  
   Allows a new user to create an account in the application through a registration form.

3. **Create course 📙** ([#2](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/2))  
   Users can create new courses by adding JSON/YAML files that describe the course structure and content.

4. **Select course 📚** ([#3](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/3))  
   Users can browse and select available courses in the library.

5. **Enroll in course 👨‍💻** ([#5](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/5))  
   Allows users to enroll in a selected course, configuring their desired learning strategy.

6. **Take course 📖** ([#4](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/4))  
   Users interact with the course content blocks (questions, exercises, flashcards, etc.) to learn and practice concepts.

7. **Track progress 📊** ([#6](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/6))  
   The system tracks and displays user progress, including participation metrics and learning statistics.

8. **Repeat failed questions ❌** (Additional feature) ([#12](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/12))  
   At the end of a question block, failed questions are repeated with a life system to reinforce learning.

9. **Level up 📈** (Additional feature) ([#13](https://github.com/antoniiolpzzz/PDS-CuriousMind/issues/13))  
   Users earn points by completing content blocks, leveling up according to their progress.

Each of these use cases covers key functionalities for the **CuriousMind** learning experience.
