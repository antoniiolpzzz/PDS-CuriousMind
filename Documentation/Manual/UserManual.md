## What is CuriousMind?

CuriousMind is a desktop application aimed at users of all ages, designed to help them learn or reinforce knowledge across a wide variety of subjects. The application is organized into different courses, which can be either default courses provided by the CuriousMind developers or custom courses created by the users themselves.

This is an interactive program that makes learning languages, music, history, or even programming languages much more visual and engaging than simply reading books or searching for information online. It includes different types of questions such as multiple-choice tests, fill-in-the-gap exercises, visual games using flashcards, and even translation questions for language learning ‚Äî all of which make the learning process more dynamic and enjoyable.
